# sci_chrome
A simple extension that uses sci-hub to get scientific articles. For Chrome. 

To install it: 
* Open the extension panel
* Check the "Developer mode" option
* Load unpacked extension and select the sci_chrome folder

To use it:
* On the scientific article webpage, click on the sci_chrome skull extension
* Profit

If sci-hub gets shut-down again and if this page isn't refreshed, it just means that we need to use another domain name. In the eventPage.js file, just replace the domain name (.tw to something else) with a known sci-hub mirror and reinstall the extension (delete and reload it).

I would like to thank Aix-Marseille Universit√© that gave (under the GNU license) the template for this addon with the lama addon (https://github.com/SCD-Aix-Marseille-Universite/lama-addons). I am glad that this gave me the opportunity, at a minimal involvment, to ease the access to sci-hub and disseminate scientific knowledge.
